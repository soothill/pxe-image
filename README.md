# Custom openSUSE ISO builder

This repository contains a KIWI description and supporting automation for building a
custom openSUSE-based ISO image. The resulting image:

- installs on the smallest disk detected at first boot;
- mirrors the network configuration of the host interface used during the build;
- validates and installs additional packages before the image is produced;
- enables or disables services as requested; and
- provisions local users with SSH keys sourced from GitHub while granting sudo access.

## Repository layout

└── README.md
```

## Prerequisites

The host performing the build must run openSUSE (Leap 15.5 or newer) and have the following
packages installed:

- `kiwi-ng`
- `zypper`
- `iproute2`
- `python3`

Ensure you have network connectivity to GitHub and the openSUSE repositories referenced
in `kiwi/custom-image.kiwi`.

## Configuration

All runtime customisation is driven through a JSON file. The example at
`config/sample-config.json` demonstrates the expected structure:

```json
{
  "packages": ["vim", "htop"],
  "services": {
    "enable": ["sshd.service"],
    "disable": []
  },
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "deploy",
      "gecos": "Deployment User",
      "shell": "/bin/bash",
      "password": "changeme",
      "github_keys": [
        {"type": "user", "user": "octocat"},
        {"type": "repo", "owner": "octocat", "repo": "keys", "path": "deploy.pub", "ref": "main"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `packages`: a list of additional RPM names that will be validated with `zypper info`
  before `kiwi-ng` is invoked and installed during the KIWI `config` stage.
- `services.enable` / `services.disable`: services that should be enabled/started or
  disabled/stopped on first boot.
- `users`: each user is created on first boot, added to the `sudo` (and `wheel` if present)
  groups, and has their `authorized_keys` file populated from GitHub. Supported key sources:
  - `{ "type": "user", "user": "github_username" }` downloads from
    `https://github.com/<user>.keys`.
  - `{ "type": "repo", "owner": "org", "repo": "repository", "path": "keys/user.pub", "ref": "main" }`
    fetches a file from the repository via `raw.githubusercontent.com`.
  - `{ "type": "url", "url": "https://example.com/keys.pub" }` downloads a file directly.
  - `password` (optional) sets the user's password. Set `password_is_hashed` to `true` when the
    value already contains a crypt-compatible hash so it can be passed through to `chpasswd`
    untouched. Plain text passwords are accepted and hashed on the target automatically.

### Generating JSON from simple text files

For simpler workflows you can maintain three newline-delimited text files under `config/` and
generate the JSON automatically:

- `config/users.txt`: each line follows `username password repo[:path][@ref] [attribute=value ...]`.
  Additional attributes include `gecos`, `shell`, `home`, `uid`, `gid`, `github_user`, and
  `github_url`. Prefix a password with `hash:` to mark it as pre-hashed or use `-`/`none` to
  skip password management.
- `config/packages.txt`: one package name per line.
- `config/services.txt`: systemd units that should be enabled and started on first boot.

Convert these files into JSON with:

```bash
make config-json OUTPUT_CONFIG=config/rendered.json
```

The rendered JSON can then be passed to `bin/build-image` or `make build` via the `CONFIG`
variable.

## Building an image

1. Adjust the configuration JSON to match the required packages, services and users.
2. Run the build wrapper:

   ```bash
   sudo bin/build-image \
     --config config/sample-config.json \
     --description kiwi \
     --target-dir build/artifacts
   ```

   The wrapper performs package validation, renders the overlay (including the host's
   active network configuration) and invokes `kiwi-ng`.

3. The resulting ISO is placed under `build/artifacts/`. The directory also contains
   build logs generated by KIWI.

Pass `--interface <device>` to override the automatically detected interface or
`--skip-build` to render the overlay without executing `kiwi-ng` (useful for debugging).
Additional KIWI arguments may be appended after `--extra-kiwi-args`.

## Makefile workflow

A `Makefile` is provided to streamline the two-step build process:

- `make help` prints a summary of available targets and overridable variables.
- `make config-json OUTPUT_CONFIG=config/rendered.json` turns the simple text inputs into a
  JSON configuration file that can be consumed by the build tooling.
- `make download CONFIG=path/to/config.json` renders the overlay (mirroring the host network configuration) and runs `kiwi-ng system prepare` to download the RPM payload into `build/artifacts/`.
- `make build` depends on `download` and executes `bin/build-image` end-to-end to produce the ISO in the target directory.
- `make clean` removes the overlay and artifact directories.

Variables such as `CONFIG`, `TARGET_DIR`, `OVERLAY_ROOT`, `EXTRA_KIWI_ARGS`, and `SUDO` can be overridden on the command line, e.g. `make build CONFIG=my.json EXTRA_KIWI_ARGS="--add-profile secure"`.


## First boot automation

During the first boot of the generated image, the `custom-firstboot.service` systemd unit
runs `/usr/local/sbin/custom-firstboot.sh`, which:

1. Detects the smallest disk using `detect-smallest-disk.sh`, records the target under
   `/etc/custom/install_target`, and (when `kiwi-install` is available) installs the image
   onto that disk automatically.
2. Creates requested users, fetches their SSH keys from GitHub and ensures they are members
   of the `sudo` group.
3. Enables/disables the requested services.

Logs from this process are stored at `/var/log/custom-firstboot.log` inside the provisioned
system.
